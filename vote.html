                <h4>Why bother voting?</h4>
                <p>The United States of America is a democracy, which is a system of government in which the leaders are chosen by the people. How are these leaders chosen, you may ask? Voting, of course! If you are 18 years or older, and are a US citizen, you should exercise your right to vote this November. Voting is how you make your voice heard, and get your values into the government. So go out and vote!</p>

            <div class="two">
                <h4>How does voting work, exactly?</h4>
                <p>In the United States, we choose our president by a system called the electoral college, which is when each state gets a certain amount of votes and all the votes are counted to determine the winner. So for example, the state of New Jersey gave its 14 votes to the democratic party, as they got the majority of the vote in that state. So if you want to swing your state to your preferred candidate, go out and vote!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="three">
                <h4>Other non-presidential races</h4>
                <p>In case you don't know, you don't just vote for the president on election day. You also vote for your state senators and congressmen. These elections are just as important as the presidency, as the senate and house of represenatives dictate the actions the president can take. So do your research on these candidates and make the right choice as to who you want representing you in Washington.</p>
